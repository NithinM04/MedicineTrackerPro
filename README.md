‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline Configuration Overview (Jenkins)
This CI/CD pipeline automates the entire process of building, testing, securing, and deploying the MedicineTrackerPro application. It starts with fetching the latest code, followed by comprehensive testing and coverage generation. Code quality and security are rigorously enforced through multiple static analysis and vulnerability scanning tools. The application is containerized using Docker, with the resulting image subjected to thorough vulnerability checks and SBOM generation. After passing all necessary verifications, the Docker image is pushed to a registry and deployed to Railway. A final health check ensures the application is running correctly post-deployment.

Detailed Pipeline Stages:
Tools Installation: Ensures that necessary tools like Node.js, Docker, and Trivy are installed and configured on the Jenkins server, utilizing Jenkins plugins for Git, Docker, SonarQube Scanner, OWASP Dependency-Check, and Trivy integration.

Git-CheckOut: Clones the MedicineTrackerPro repository from GitHub (https://github.com/Aakashjn/MedicineTrackerPro.git), ensuring the pipeline works with the latest codebase.

Run Tests and Generate Coverage: Executes automated tests using the application's configured test runner (e.g., Jest for Node.js backend) to validate component correctness and application logic. Simultaneously, code coverage tools (like Istanbul/NYC) generate coverage reports, which feed into SonarQube for quality assessment.

SonarQube Analysis: Performs static analysis on the codebase to identify bugs, code smells, security vulnerabilities, and duplications. It consumes the test coverage report to assess code testability and applies pre-configured quality gates to determine if the code meets required standards.

GitLeaks Secrets Scan: Scans the codebase and Git history using Gitleaks to detect sensitive data leaks such as API keys, credentials, or tokens, preventing accidental exposure of critical infrastructure credentials.

Shell Script Linting: All shell scripts used in the project are linted using Shellcheck for syntax errors, deprecated syntax, insecure command usage, and portability issues, improving script reliability and maintainability.

Docker Build: Packages the backend application into a Docker container using its Dockerfile. This step captures all dependencies, runtime environments, and configurations, creating a portable image vital for consistency across environments.

Syft SBOM Generation: Uses Syft to generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from the built Docker image. This SBOM provides a comprehensive inventory of all software components, crucial for compliance, supply chain security, and vulnerability tracking.

Trivy Image Scanner: Integrates Trivy to perform container image vulnerability scanning. It detects vulnerabilities in operating system packages and application dependencies, ensuring that only secure images are deployed.

Grype Image Scanner: Provides an in-depth container image vulnerability scan using Grype (by Anchore). It detects known vulnerabilities in packages and dependencies of container images, helping to flag insecure images early and maintain a strong security posture.

Docker Push: Pushes the newly built and scanned Docker image to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub), making it available for deployment.

OWASP Dependency Checker: Performs a detailed scan of the application's declared dependencies (e.g., in package.json) using OWASP Dependency-Check. It compares them against known CVEs in public databases and flags those with security issues, providing CVSS scores and remediation advice.

Deploy to Docker and Railway: The application container is first deployed to a local Docker runtime for final pre-deployment validation, ensuring it works in isolation. Subsequently, using the Railway CLI, the backend and frontend services are deployed to the Railway cloud platform, which handles environment provisioning and runtime monitoring.

Health Check: The final stage performs automated health checks on the live application by sending HTTP requests to predefined endpoints (e.g., /health). It verifies that the deployed services are running, responsive, and returning expected HTTP status codes (usually 200).

(Assuming frontend code is in a separate directory like frontend)

cd ../frontend # Adjust path if different
npm install

Running the Application
Start the Backend Development Server:

cd ../backend # Go back to backend directory
npm start # Or 'node server.js' depending on your package.json scripts

Start the Frontend Development Server:

cd ../frontend # Go to frontend directory
npm run dev # Or 'npm start' depending on your package.json scripts

Building and Running with Docker (Optional)
If you prefer to run the application using Docker locally:

Build the Docker Image:

cd .. # Go back to the root project directory
docker build -t medicinetrackerpro-app .

Run the Docker Container:

docker run -d --name medicinetrackerpro-local -p 4000:4000 medicinetrackerpro-app

The backend API should then be accessible on http://localhost:4000.
